          A terms and conditions agreement outlines the website administratorâ€™s
          rules regarding user behavior and provides information about the
          actions the website administrator can and will perform. Essentially,
          your terms and conditions text is a contract between your website and
          its users. In the event of a legal dispute, arbitrators will look at
          it to determine whether each party acted within their rights.
